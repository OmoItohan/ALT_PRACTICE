    <h3>HOBBIES</h3><hr>
    <P>Honestly? sleeping!!!!!! I love sleeping. I love to travel, discover new places, foods, culture etc, make new friends, watch cartoons, daydream. I am passionate about Women's rights and advocacy against gender bias and inequality. Most importantly I am a lover of romance, comedy and korean drama, anything else is a snoozefest.</P>
